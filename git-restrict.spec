%description
A minimal utility that allows repository permission management based on
ssh keys when used with the command directive in ssh's authorized_keys
file.
 
If used, it will only allow `git-upload-pack` and `git-receive-pack` as
the commands allowed to be ran by a specific user/SSH key.
 
git-restrict is also compiled as a static binary so it's easy to use it
in chroot environments. This is obviously intentional.
